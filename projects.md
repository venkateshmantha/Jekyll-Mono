### [Virtual Eye](https://github.com/venkateshmantha/virtualeye) 
An Android application for the visually impaired; _Virtual Eye_ lets the user click an image through the app, analyzes and vocally describes it back to him/her.

Started as a hackathon project in Duke University last year, I built the application as a part of HackDuke's _Health&Wellness_ track to serve as an aid to the visually challenged. This excerpt _Findings from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data release established that an estimated 23.7 million adult Americans (or 10% of all adult Americans) reported they either "have trouble" seeing, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses, or that they are blind or unable to see at all._ from an [article](http://www.afb.org/info/blindness-statistics/2) by the American Foundation for the Blind has further driven me into developing the app.

Virtual Eye uses image recognition and machine learning to analyze the image, retrieve the keywords and intelligently formulate the story from the image. The app then uses Android's Text-to-Speech module to vocally describe the image back to the user. Below are a few screengrabs of the app in action.![logo]({{site.baseurl}}/images/veye_0.jpg)

#### What's next for Virtual Eye?

The app is currently in its Beta version and needs further testing and few design improvements to be live on PlayStore. It currently runs using Microsoft's Cognitive Api's and a rehaul of its analyzing module by writing a self-reliant analysis model to enable scale and volume is also being looked upon.
